## Movement analysis using IMU sensors

> * Extracting gait parameters and human center of mass to explore the relationship between human movement and cardiovascular function.
> * Deploy a Kalman filter for orientation estimation and calibrate the angle and direction of the IMU. Also, develop algorithms to extract gait parameters and COM.
