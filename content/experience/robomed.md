### Introduction
Minimally invasive surgery requires devices that are precise, compact, and safe to operate in sensitive environments such as MRI. Traditional actuation systems like cable-driven or magnetic mechanisms present drawbacks such as hysteresis, low force output, or incompatibility with MRI. To address these challenges, we developed a hydraulic tendon-driven guidewire system that is fully MRI-compatible, electrically passive, and capable of 3D steeringâ€”all within a 3mm outer diameter.

### Key Contributions
- ðŸš€ Designed and prototyped a **hydraulic tendon-driven catheter** that is **non-conductive**, **non-magnetic**, and **MRI-safe**.  
- ðŸ§  Developed and validated a **static and kinematic model** of the guidewire under quasi-static conditions.  
- ðŸ”¬ Conducted **bench-top experiments** to evaluate bending behavior and repeatability of tip actuation.  
- ðŸ›  Explored **material choices** for soft hydraulics to maintain flexibility while minimizing transmission losses.  

### Outcome
This research demonstrates a novel approach to achieving compact, steerable, and MRI-compatible guidewires using hydraulic actuation, offering improved maneuverability and safety in minimally invasive procedures.
