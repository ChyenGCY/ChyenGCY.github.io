## 3D Center-of-Mass Estimation for Rehabilitation Using IMU-UWB Fusion  
**Southern University of Science and Technology ‚Äì Shenzhen, China**  
**Project Lead, Innovation Funding Application (Guangdong Province)**  
*Skills: Sensor Fusion, Embedded Systems, UWB Positioning, Kalman Filter, Biomechanics*

### Introduction
Accurate human motion tracking plays a key role in rehabilitation and elderly care. However, traditional systems are limited by environmental constraints, high cost, and short battery life. This project aims to develop a **portable, high-precision motion capture system** that uses **fusion of IMU and UWB** sensors to estimate the **3D center of mass (CoM)** in real-time, even in magnetically disturbed environments.

### Key Contributions
- üë£ Designed a **wearable motion capture system** that fuses **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)** and **UWB (Ultra-Wideband)** positioning to achieve accurate and drift-resistant human motion tracking.
- üìê Developed algorithms to estimate **3D CoM trajectory** in real-time, supporting applications like **balance training**, **fall detection**, and **post-stroke rehabilitation**.
- üîã Achieved a **low-power, long-duration** embedded system suitable for daily use in home or clinical settings.
- üß† Applied **quaternion-based Kalman filtering** to integrate UWB‚Äôs absolute positioning with IMU‚Äôs orientation tracking.
- üîç Addressed gaps in current research, particularly in **upper-body CoM estimation**, which is often ignored in gait-based methods.

### Outcome
- Proposed system offers **improved robustness and precision** in non-laboratory environments.
- Expected to meet **clinical assessment needs** for balance and movement disorders.
- Successfully passed early prototyping and simulation validation; hardware prototyping and hospital trials are underway.

### Future Work
- Complete **algorithm optimization and hardware integration** for real-world testing.
- Conduct **clinical trials** for validation in elderly care and neuro-rehabilitation contexts.
- Expand system to track **multi-segment CoM dynamics** in complex motions.
