### Introduction
Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA), especially using the Direct Anterior Approach (DAA), demands precise placement of the acetabular implant. Traditional methods like CT are accurate but costly and invasive. This project developed a **compact, cost-effective, and wireless inertial navigation system** to guide DAA procedures using IMU sensors for real-time, radiation-free measurement of implant angles.

### Key Contributions
- ðŸ›  **Designed an integrated hardware system** with a nine-axis IMU and a single-axis gyroscope, embedded MCU, and power management in two sensor modules (on-handle and on-body).
- ðŸ“¶ Developed a **wireless data transmission system** using Wi-Fi and custom communication protocols to ensure real-time updates.
- ðŸŽ¯ Implemented algorithms to compute **radiographic anteversion (RA)** and **radiographic inclination (RI)** angles, critical for THA implant alignment.
- ðŸ§ª Conducted both **sensor-level** (robot arm reference) and **system-level** (optical motion capture) experiments to validate accuracy and drift.
- ðŸ’» Created a **3D Unity-based visualization tool** for surgeons to monitor orientation in real time.

### Outcome
- Achieved **RA and RI accuracy of 1.24Â° and 1.89Â° RMSE**, respectively.
- Maintained **dynamic drift under 0.13Â°/min** and **Pearson correlation > 0.995**, confirming high stability and repeatability.
- Outperformed many commercial and research systems in usability and accuracy.
- Validated a **fully wireless and surgeon-friendly system**â€”a promising step toward clinical integration.

### Future Work
- Conduct clinical trials to validate system effectiveness in live surgeries.
- Expand the navigation system for use in other orthopedic surgical approaches.
