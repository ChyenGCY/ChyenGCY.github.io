## Motion capture for rehabilitation

> * Integrate ultra-wide band (UWB) technology and inertial measurement unit (IMU) to develop a motion capture system to recovery human motion.
> * Help develop Unity visualization and design the python code for signal transmission Apply deep learning enabling sparse motion capture.
> * Apply the system on healthy subjects for rehabilitation exercise and evaluate the effectiveness of the system.
