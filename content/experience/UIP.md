## UWB-IMU Fusion Motion Capture System for Rehabilitation  
**Southern University of Science and Technology â€“ Shenzhen, China**  
**Undergraduate Innovation Project**  
*Skills: Sensor Fusion, Embedded Systems, Deep Learning, Human Pose Estimation*

### Introduction
As motion capture technology expands in medical applications, this project proposes a cost-effective and portable system for full-body motion tracking using **IMU and UWB fusion**. The goal is to support continuous rehabilitation assessment with high precision across diverse environments, overcoming the cost and complexity of commercial systems.

### Key Contributions
- ðŸ§  Designed a **wearable sensor network** combining **Ultra-Wideband (UWB)** and **Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)** with **long battery life** and **anti-magnetic interference**.  
- ðŸ“¡ Developed a **communication protocol** using UWB for real-time, multi-node IMU data transmission.  
- ðŸ”§ Implemented a **sensor fusion pipeline** using **Kalman filtering** and **complementary filters** for accurate positioning and orientation.  
- ðŸ•º Built a **pose estimation pipeline** using an **RNN neural network** trained on the **DIP-IMU dataset** and fine-tuned with simulated noise.  
- ðŸ’¡ Introduced **LOS/NLOS classification** to improve UWB accuracy in obstructed environments.  
- ðŸ§ª Achieved **3D pose estimation** with RMSE of **4.6 cm** in position and outperformed baseline models in accuracy.

### Outcome
The project completed two design iterations:
1. **System prototype** with real-time visualization and OpenSim integration.
2. **Sensor fusion and neural network-based pose estimation**, achieving **state-of-the-art accuracy** on benchmark datasets.

The system shows strong potential for at-home rehabilitation and scalable healthcare technology.

### Future Work
- Improve **NLOS signal classification** for enhanced UWB accuracy.  
- Collect **real-world UWB-IMU datasets** for further training and validation.  
- Optimize the neural network architecture for real-time inference.
