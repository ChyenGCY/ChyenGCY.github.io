{{< about-section
    title="About me"
    content="I am an engineer with a strong foundation in Intelligent Medical Engineering, driven by a deep fascination for technology and its potential to improve lives. My journey began with a curiosity for complex systems, which led me to disassemble devices and explore their inner workings. This passion grew through my involvement in university robotics competitions and advanced coursework in computer science and biomedical engineering. <br/> My experience is a blend of technical expertise and collaborative research. I've contributed to projects like an IMU-based motion capture system for rehabilitation and led efforts to apply this technology in surgical settings. My skills in Python programming, 3D modeling, and deep learning have been crucial in these endeavors, demonstrating my ability to learn quickly and adapt to new challenges. <br/> Beyond academics, I am a well-rounded individual with interests in photography, video editing, event organization, archery, and language studies. These hobbies reflect my sociable and curious nature, and they complement my technical pursuits by fostering creativity and leadership skills. <br/> I am committed to deepening my understanding of Electrical and Computer Engineering through advanced studies, with the ultimate goal of contributing to innovative technological research. My approach combines a holistic vision of technology's role in health and a relentless drive to explore new frontiers in engineering."
